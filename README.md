Local PC Game Importer.
</a>

#Info:
</a>
Make Folders on all drrives wo use "Games" "Repacks". e.g "D:\Games" "E:\Repacks" 

</a>
Any Game in "Games" gets added as "isntalled" and all exe's get addeda as playactions

</a>
any Repack in "Repacks" gets added as uninstalled but makes a "Install" action for the "Setup.exe" file in folder 

</a>
if in both "Repacks" & "Games" it gets added as Installed and adds a "Install" action

</a>
if Game in "Games" has an "Unisntall.exe" itll make a "unsinstall" Action as well

</a>
if game was uninstalled and then moved to a diffrent drive, itll update InstallDir

</a>

Uses:
</a>

Portable drive with Repacks or a SMB with Network drives set up also work fine. can also play games via smb but can cause slower boot ups/input delay (possible and worked well for me)
</a>

Keeps it easy to see what games are avalible localy
